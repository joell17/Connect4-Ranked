How does the app work:
----------------------
    - A user starts the app:
        - The main menu opens
        - Log in automatically if user is remembered
            - Get users primary and secondary skins
            - Load in user's unlocked skins
            - Show option for user stats 
                - wins
                - losses
                - rank
                - sign out

    - The user selects local pvp
        - The LocalGame react-route is loaded

    - The user selects Online Casual
        - If user not logged in, don't allow
        - Players post their primary skin
            - request:
                - image_name
        - Wait till both players have successfully posted
        - Players get opponent's primary skin
            - response:
                - image_name
        - Go to OnlineCasualGame react-route
            - boardData is managed in backend
            - player_turn is managed in backend
            - Route for placing piece:
                - Checks if it was received from the correct player
                - Update BoardData
                - Send response to both players if successful
                    - Player renders new piece in correct position
                    - request:
                        - player_id
                        - piece_position
                    - response:
                        - placement_successful (bool)
                        - player_won (bool)
                        - Does this need to be a separate route that players get from?
                - If player_won
                    - update records of both players accordingly

    - The user selects 'Online Ranked' (TBD)
    
    - The user selects skins

        - I hate the idea of using context api, so I'd rather not
        - Show the current primary and secondary skins
            - The primary and secondary skin should've been gotten on login
        - User selects which one they would like to update
        - User can select from options they have unlocked
            - Should also be gotten on login
                - Skins should ordered, so just it could just be the index of the last skin unlocked
        - User can hit 'Apply' button
            - request:
                - primary_skin_name

Here's a refined version of your plan for the Online Casual feature:

- Online Casual
    - Matchmaking
        - User clicks "Find Match" in the side menu.
        - Backend initiates matchmaking, trying to pair two available sessions.
        - Once matched, backend establishes a game session for both players.

    - Gameplay
        - Player attempts to place a piece on the board.
        - Backend validates the move:
        - If invalid, sends a failure signal to the current player.
        - If valid, updates the game state, sends a success signal to both players, and switches the active player.
        - Frontend listens for signals from the backend and updates the board accordingly.
        - This can be done using WebSockets or polling for updates.
        - If a win condition is detected:
        - Display the winner.
        - Backend updates user stats.
        - Clear the board and show rematch and menu options.
        - Backend manages rematch requests or disconnection.

    - Post-Game
        - Implement a timer for rematch decisions to keep the flow moving.
        - Handle cases where one player wants a rematch and the other does not.


- Fix the board
    - Insert pieces top-down (from the board to the column)
    - Move state up
        - Keep track of existing pieces in the board
        - Columns call hook on board, that places piece
