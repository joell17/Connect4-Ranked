 HTTPS=true yarn start

Your project seems to be coming along nicely! Here are a few general concerns and suggestions for your entire project:

1. **Security:** Ensure that your user authentication and session management are secure. Consider using HTTPS for all communication between the client and the server to protect sensitive data.

2. **Error Handling:** Make sure you have comprehensive error handling throughout your application, both on the frontend and the backend. This includes handling network errors, server errors, and user input validation errors.

3. **Performance:** Test the performance of your application under different conditions, such as high user load or slow network connections. Optimize your code and database queries for efficiency.

4. **Scalability:** Consider how your application will scale as the number of users grows. This includes scaling your server infrastructure, optimizing your database, and ensuring that your code can handle increased traffic.

5. **Testing:** Implement automated tests for critical parts of your application, such as user authentication, game logic, and database interactions. This will help you catch bugs early and ensure that your application behaves as expected.

6. **User Experience:** Pay attention to the user experience of your application. This includes designing a user-friendly interface, providing clear feedback to users, and ensuring that the application is responsive and fast.

7. **Code Quality:** Keep your code clean and well-organized. Use consistent coding styles, document your code, and refactor as needed to improve readability and maintainability.

8. **Deployment:** Plan for the deployment of your application, including setting up a production server, configuring your environment, and establishing a deployment process.

9. **Monitoring:** Set up monitoring and logging for your application to track its performance and detect issues in real-time.

10. **Feedback:** Gather feedback from users to identify areas for improvement and new features to add.

Overall, it's important to continuously test, iterate, and improve your application based on user feedback and performance metrics. Good luck with your project!
