## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose for data management
- **Authentication:** Passport.js with Google OAuth
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSocket
- **Security:** HTTPS setup with Nginx as a reverse proxy
- **Session Management:** express-session with MongoStore
- **Environment Management:** dotenv for environment variable management

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Nginx
- An HTTPS certificate for secure communication

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/connect4-online.git
   cd connect4-online
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   DATABASE_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/connect4db
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
   SESSION_SECRET=your_secret
   KEY_PATH=path_to_your_private.key
   CERT_PATH=path_to_your_certificate.crt
   ```

4. **Configure Nginx**
   Set up Nginx as a reverse proxy to direct traffic to your application and handle HTTPS.

5. **Start the backend server**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

6. **Start the frontend application**
